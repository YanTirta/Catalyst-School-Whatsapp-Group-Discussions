There I clarify with information about when this event will end.

I also enlarged and bolded the information;

11/1/23, 6:07 PM - Yan Tirta: Based on the discussion at Estuary, I remember there was an opportunity to join via Zoom as well. Is that a follow-up?

If so, who will provide the Zoom link? 11/1/23, 6:32 PM - Yan Tirta: Here I have prepared the Zoom link as an anticipatory step if you also want to distribute a Zoom link;

11/1/23, 9:04 PM - +62 816-4265-148: Ready to share?

11/1/23, 21:05 - Adhikayev: This afternoon the QR code had an error. Sir @6285804602617, Mas @6282264579005, is the QR code working?

11/1/23, 9:14 PM - Yan Tirta: QR can work. There is only a slight difference in perception about the rewards distribution mechanism from CardanoSpot.io.

Rewards from CardanoSpot.io will be distributed after December 31, 2023 to participants who have registered via random QR code scans.

11/1/23, 21:15 - Yan Tirta: Yes, Mr Nas.

11/1/23, 9:21 PM - Yan Tirta: Here is the *.jpeg version of the above publication;

11/1/23, 21:34 - Yan Tirta: For Mr. @628164265148 , Mr. @6281239330962 , Mas @6282264579005 , Mas @6281413574298 and Mas @6281905378266 please note, from the 2nd to the 4th there will be a Cardano Summit in Dubai. You can follow it via the following website; https://summit.cardano.org/

11/1/23, 9:35 PM - +62 816-4265-148: Can I publish this on social media?

11/1/23, 9:35 PM - +62 816-4265-148: Thanks for the info.

11/1/23, 21:35 - Yan Tirta: Please Mr Nas

11/1/23, 9:36 PM - Deren T: Okay, sir. Thanks for the info üôè

11/1/23, 21:40 - Yan Tirta: For your information, in Indonesia there is also a Cardano Summit Localized in Jakarta which will take place on November 4. We from the Cardano Indonesia community have taken the position of hosting the Cardano Summit Localized in rotation.

*If the UGM team is willing and ready to host next year, we will start coordinating. All funding comes from the Cardano Foundation.*

Which Mr. Nas and Mr. Adhika already have direct connections with. 11/1/23, 21:41 - +62 816-4265-148: Interesting Mas @6281239330962 11/1/23, 22:06 - +62 816-4265-148: Next year around October there will be an International Conference hosted by DTETI, what if it is also one Cardano Summit? 11/1/23, 22:13 - Yan Tirta: Conceptually, it is possible Mr. Nas. In terms of time, it will most likely require coordination and careful consideration.

Cardano Summit Global usually takes place in November and Cardano Summit Localized follows.

This means that if there is a possibility that the DTETI International Conference will be rescheduled to be closer to the Cardano Global Summit, Mr. Nas' idea might work.

In other words, for example, the DTETI International Conference is on October 28-31. On November 4, the UGM/DTETI Cardano Summit. *So it seems like one series.* 11/1/23, 22:14 - +62 816-4265-148: Or it could be closer so it connects 11/1/23, 22:14 - Yan Tirta: That's right, Mr. Nas 11/1/23, 22:17 - Yan Tirta: One more thing that Mr. Nas and Mr. Adhika need to know; the quota for Cardano Ambassadors in one country is 2 (two). Until now, Indonesia only has one.

In my opinion, becoming a Cardano Ambassador is most suitable for students because the position/performance expectations are similar to Mas @6282264579005's current position in the student affairs field.

The Cardano Ambassador position itself is also paid by the Cardano Foundation in the amount of IDR 3 million.

11/1/23, 22:18 - +62 816-4265-148: Noted

11/1/23, 10:19 PM - Yan Tirta: Here are the details of becoming a Cardano Ambassador;

11/1/23, 22:19 - +62 816-4265-148: üëç

11/1/23, 22:24 - Lintang Asmoro: OK Mr Yan üôè

11/1/23, 22:26 - Lintang Asmoro: Thank you very much, Mr. Yan, our plan is to prioritize offline attendance first, if there are too many, the online zoom link will be distributed, Sir, the reason is that if it is announced at the beginning that it can be online, priority students will prefer zoom rather than attending meetings in person, considering that face-to-face meetings have a more significant impact on participants' understanding üôè

11/1/23, 22:27 - Lintang Asmoro: Thank you very much Mr Yan üôè

11/1/23, 10:28 PM - Yan Tirta: Well noted and understood. Thanks for the explanation.

11/1/23, 22:28 - Lintang Asmoro: OK, you're welcome Mr Yan üôè

11/2/23, 11:03 - Yan Tirta: Additional information for the UGM team when considering hosting the Cardano Summit Localized is the budget* provided;

1. 2022 - IDR 90 million
2. 2023 - IDR 40 million

**budget is highly dependent on the value of ADA at that time*

11/2/23, 11:09 - +62 816-4265-148: Noted

11/2/23, 11:09 - +62 816-4265-148: If possible, it can be held in conjunction with the conference in Bali.

11/2/23, 15:09 - Yan Tirta: Interesting Mr. Nas. Incidentally, Bali has been targeted by the Indonesian Cardano community to become the Cardano Summit Localized. The obstacle at that time was that there was no dedicated team that could stand by there.

11/2/23, 15:10 - Yan Tirta: Bali itself has a very active Web3 community. The potential to attract participants is high.

11/2/23, 3:29 PM - +62 816-4265-148: Match

11/2/23, 15:29 - +62 816-4265-148: Hopefully we can synergize

11/2/23, 15:36 - Yan Tirta: Okay Mr. Nas. Let me coordinate from my side.

11/2/23, 6:02 PM - +62 816-4265-148: Thank you

11/3/23, 11:06 - Adhikayev: Later to prepare the room this afternoon you can contact Mas Andhi, Mas @6282264579005

11/3/23, 11:06 - Adhikayev: I have briefed

11/3/23, 11:09 - Lintang Asmoro: OK Mr Adhika, thank you very much sir üôè

11/4/23, 08:47 - Yan Tirta: Good morning UGM team and Mas @6282264579005 . Due to the lack of Cardano Summit personnel in Jakarta, the two educators (Mas Andy and Mas Syarbel) would like to ask for permission to not be able to attend the first edition.

I was asked to temporarily replace. So, can we have a dress rehearsal before the workshop session? To make sure all the equipment/Zoom is running smoothly.

11/4/23, 08:53 - +62 814-1357-4298: Okay, Mr. Yan, here we have set up the zoom equipment and have logged in via the zoom link that you have provided. Perhaps you can start the meeting as the host.

11/4/23, 09:08 - Lintang Asmoro: Good morning Mr. Yan, may I confirm whether Mr. Yan will come and be present in person at the DTMI campus? üôè

11/4/23, 09:13 - Yan Tirta: I happen to have to go out of town and will deliver the material via Zoom. In the next session I will be physically present for documentation tasks and to assist the UGM team admin.

11/4/23, 09:13 - Yan Tirta: Okay, I'll test now.

11/4/23, 09:56 - +62 814-1357-4298: Excuse me, sir, I would like to update the participants who have arrived, totaling 8 out of 36 registered participants. When can we start, sir?

11/4/23, 09:56 - +62 814-1357-4298: We have and are reminding other participants to join soonüôèüèª

11/4/23, 09:57 - +62 816-4265-148: I'm asking permission to assist from Jakarta, I'm still on duty in JKT

11/4/23, 10:04 - +62 814-1357-4298: Excuse me, sir, I would like to open an activity as a moderator, pleaseüôèüèª

11/4/23, 10:04 - Yan Tirta: Please

11/4/23, 10:04 - Yan Tirta: Yes, Mr. Nas

11/4/23, 12:29 PM - Yan Tirta: Thanks for the coordination, Mas @6282264579005 , Mas @6281413574298 and Mas @6281905378266 . Great effort!

Sorry, I was over 30 minutes. Next time, don't hesitate to remind me. It's a shame if it's over 2 hours, usually everyone is exhausted.

11/4/23, 12:38 - +62 814-1357-4298: Okay, Mr. Yan. Thank you for the material and appreciation. We will pay attention again to the duration of the implementation.

11/4/23, 13:02 - Lintang Asmoro: You're welcome, thank you again Mr. Yan. Students are happy and enthusiastic about the project catalyst, in the future we will try to make the impact of today's enthusiasm even more crowded üôè

11/4/23, 13:33 - Yan Tirta: Thank goodness then. The most important thing is how students feel the benefits from the beginning, are comfortable with the blockchain and understand the method of getting money properly/working properly.

11/4/23, 13:34 - Yan Tirta: Hopefully there will be a domino effect from there so that they are confident and calm in submitting proposals.

11/4/23, 13:36 - Yan Tirta: Mas Lintang and Mas Lutfhi, can you help me with the following?

1. workshop documentation
2. quiz winner email list
3. number of attendance list

11/5/23, 15:08 - Lintang Asmoro: For point (3) please wait a moment, Mr. Yan, because there are several participants who came without filling out the form that we have distributed. So we identify and make sure first üôè

11/5/23, 18:14 - Yan Tirta: Well noted Mas @6282264579005 , thank you for your cooperation. Please note, for work life balance, follow up discussion in chat does not need to be on weekends, I can understand.

Please take a rest on the weekend and follow up on weekdays. Have a good rest and weekend, Mas Lintang.

11/5/23, 20:19 - Lintang Asmoro: OK Mr Yan, thank you very much üôè

11/6/23, 13:37 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon, Sir @628164265148 . Regarding the Cardano Summit held by DTETI UGM in conjunction with an international conference;

1. allows to be held

2. the process remains through submitting a proposal to the Cardano Foundation

3a) factors that will make it easier for UGM to obtain funding; a. clarity of the international conference event b. scope of the international conference audience c. international conference partners

3b) Another factor that will make it easier for UGM to get funding is the enthusiasm to learn from UGM students 11/6/23, 13:39 - Yan Tirta: What the UGM Team needs to consider when holding the Cardano Summit is;

1. UGM's position is a partner

2. Cardano Summit's neutrality needs to be maintained even though it is run by the UGM team

3. Neutrality is a consideration because Cardano's mission is to be inclusive of everyone.

11/6/23, 16:16 - +62 816-4265-148: Ready, thank you, we will try to follow up

11/6/23, 16:57 - Yan Tirta: With pleasure, sir.

11/6/23, 17:22 - +62 816-4265-148: Is there a format or example of a proposal, Mr. Yan?

11/6/23, 17:30 - Yan Tirta: There is an online format, Mr. Nas, every time before the Summit it is always opened online. About 9 months before the Summit, registration is opened. I will try to get an example or offline format.

11/6/23, 17:38 - +62 816-4265-148: Thank you

11/7/23, 14:34 - Yan Tirta: DOC-20231107-WA0003. (file attached)

*NB: Especially for Mas Lintang, I leave the distribution of the funds allocated to Mas Lutfi to you because there is an agreement between the two of you that I understand.*

11/7/23, 14:40 - Deren T: Okay, Mr. Yan.

11/7/23, 14:40 - Adhikayev: ADA addresses in cardano wallet, like Nami or Daedalus

11/7/23, 14:40 - Adhikayev: *don't confuse with ETH or BTC addresses

11/7/23, 14:42 - Yan Tirta: Adding Mr. Adhika Yoroi is also possible. Daedalus needs to be noted that it requires a powerful computer/laptop. Incidentally, in the attachment above I have given a link to Yoroi

11/7/23, 15:31 - +62 816-4265-148: Here or private message, sir?

11/7/23, 3:32 PM - Yan Tirta: Just PM Mr. Nas. To implement good privacy/personal data protection practices.

1. acceleration of all sessions to once a week
2. Catalyst School content condensation from 6 sessions to 4 sessions
3. the last or fourth session is the Catalyst Incubator<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

11/9/23, 17:28 - Yan Tirta: That's right Mr Adhika

11/9/23, 5:31 PM - Yan Tirta: Here are the publications for this week's workshop;

11/9/23, 20:01 - +62 816-4265-148: Can you share it?

11/9/23, 20:03 - Adhikayev: Mas @6282264579005 for the M1 TV setup, can you setup it yourself? So that Mas Andhi doesn't need to stay on Saturday

11/9/23, 20:03 - Adhikayev: Just borrow the tools

11/9/23, 20:07 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay, Mr. Adhika üôè

11/11/23, 09:09 - +62 814-1357-4298: Good morning, Excuse me, gentlemen and friends, Room M1 is already set up and ready to use, right?

11/11/23, 09:43 - Yan Tirta: Thank you, Mr. Luthfi. Here is the Zoom link: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86368949027?pwd=U0MvZnJ1R3dlK3VZSnlLWTRtYzk1Zz09

11/11/23, 10:10 - +62 814-1357-4298: Excuse me, sir, there are still around 5 participants and we have announced it since yesterday and this morning at 8 &amp; 9. Then for the implementation, what time is it best to start?

11/11/23, 10:11 - Yan Tirta: It's okay, we appreciate those who are on time. Those who come later can watch the YouTube recording.

11/11/23, 10:13 - Yan Tirta: Just a suggestion, maybe it needs to be asked; what day, what time, and what medium? Maybe Saturday mornings need extra effort for students.

11/11/23, 10:14 - +62 814-1357-4298: Yes, sir. Maybe 10.15?

11/11/23, 10:14 - +62 814-1357-4298: Okay, sir. Next we will try to make a poll for students.

11/11/23, 10:14 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay Mr. Yan, after this we will conduct another survey to adjust to the participants' wishes üôè

11/11/23, 10:15 - Yan Tirta: 10:15 is fine. Thank you for your cooperation everyone.

11/13/23, 09:13 - Your security code with ~ Noor Akhmad Setiawan changed. Tap to learn more.

11/13/23, 16:52 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon UGM Team. Taking the learning from last week, I am sharing the publication for this weekend early, Saturday, November 18, 2023; *(with notes)*

11/13/23, 16:52 - Yan Tirta: IMG-20231113-WA0005.jpg (file attached)

11/13/23, 4:55 PM - Yan Tirta: *The notes are as follows;*

1. still waiting for insight regarding polling from students regarding what day, what time and what format they want

2. Is there anything else that can be done to attract interest? *(for example, there was a discussion to open it to the public)*

1. important presence to help other proposals from UGM

11/14/23, 18:20 - Yan Tirta: *The second* kickstart funding assistance for blockchain developer education at UGM in the amount of $5000 for a collaboration duration of 4 (four) months from Emurgo via Cardano Spot has been disbursed.

11/14/23, 19:01 - +62 814-1357-4298: IMG-20231114-WA0001.jpg (file attached) Excuse me, sir, we would like to attach some of the polling results that have been conducted. From the results, the majority still prefer to be held on Saturday and be conducted offline. And for the implementation time, perhaps because the election day falls on Saturday (weekend), it can be tried for the afternoon/evening, sir. A little disclaimer, because the questions are not related to each other, it can be said that they are not very representative

11/14/23, 19:01 - +62 814-1357-4298: IMG-20231114-WA0003.jpg (file attached)

11/14/23, 19:01 - +62 814-1357-4298: IMG-20231114-WA0002.jpg (file attached)

11/14/23, 19:45 - +62 816-4265-148: Interesting info, I will discuss with colleagues.

11/15/23, 13:50 - Yan Tirta: Thanks for the data, Mas @6281413574298 .

This means that the participants want the workshop time to be moved back to *(take a value between)* 15:00 and the day to remain Saturday?

11/15/23, 13:51 - Yan Tirta: If you need more clarity, I am ready to explain, sir.

11/15/23, 3:14 PM - +62 816-4265-148: Ready

11/15/23, 16:36 - Yan Tirta: Mas @6281413574298 please share the Catalyst School #2 quiz winner data. So I can distribute the incentives immediately.

11/15/23, 17:14 - +62 814-1357-4298: Okay, sir. But for 2 questions, no one has confirmed until today.

11/18/23, 14:44 - Yan Tirta: FYI, Mas @6281413574298, there is a slight problem in the form of my Zoom which will be used for meetings by other teams. So later I will use Google Meet.

Therefore, we need to anticipate that there will be technical obstacles. However, as long as the Google Meet link that I provided, there is only one participant/Mr. Lutfhi himself, there should be no obstacles.

11/18/23, 14:45 - +62 814-1357-4298: Excuse me, sir, then I'll just offer you the zoom link from my account, sir. It just so happens that there is still a licensed one.

11/18/23, 2:45 PM - Yan Tirta: Can I have the session recorded?

11/18/23, 14:46 - +62 814-1357-4298: Okay, sir, maybe I'll assign your account as a host too, maybe you can record it too.

11/18/23, 14:46 - +62 814-1357-4298: Habib Luthfi Ash Shiddiqie is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.

Due to 2 core members of Catalyst School not being able to continue their responsibilities because;

1. S2 busyness
2. new office hustle and bustle

There have been quite a lot of changes in terms of;

1. distribution of funds
2. Catalyst proposal output

Just a note for the distribution of funds because the sensitive topic that has changed is that the three students who helped with operations *are now all compensated and equally.*<this message="" was="" edited=""> 11/20/23, 14:27 - Yan Tirta: In order for everyone to have one voice when communicating with students, there needs to be a coordination meeting between me and the UGM Operations Team.</this>

So can you help determine this week, before this Saturday's session, *when is the meeting time?* 11/20/23, 14:32 - Yan Tirta: üìå *Apart from that, I need the following data from the Operations Team;*

1. Zoom recording *(if the file is too large to be coordinated for data transfer via face-to-face meeting)*

2.  Attendance and documentation of last Saturday's session *(for attendance, please ask the Operations Team to include personal data as well because this is your first time participating)*

3.  List of winners of the question session<this message="" was="" edited=""> 11/20/23, 14:44 - Yan Tirta: üìå <em>Full Transparency;</em> here is the ORI Project Management file that is exactly the same as the proposal on the website:</this>

Mr. @6281905378266 probably understands a little better. If Mr. @628164265148 or the team needs direct guidance, I am available from 3:00 PM onwards.

11/30/23, 11:32 - +62 816-4265-148: IMG-20231130-WA0003.jpg (file attached) the link doesn't work sir

11/30/23, 11:44 - Yan Tirta: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/community/login

Sorry Mr. Nas, I gave the wrong link.

11/30/23, 11:44 - Yan Tirta: The above is the correct link and I have verified it.

11/30/23, 1:11 PM - +62 814-1357-4298: Excuse me, Mr. Yan, is this the same as the fund 11 that was discussed yesterday?

11/30/23, 13:21 - Yan Tirta: That's right, Mas Lutfhi.

11/30/23, 1:22 PM - Yan Tirta: Only 4 hours and 37 minutes left. For the record, just submit the proposal outline.

There are still 7 days to complete.

11/30/23, 1:24 PM - Yan Tirta: For fellow students from yesterday who are interested in continuing the Catalyst School, just copy and paste the previous Catalyst proposal at this link:

11/30/23, 1:31 PM - +62 814-1357-4298: Sorry, sir, I didn't have time to create a group for interested students yesterday, do I need to create one first?

11/30/23, 13:33 - Yan Tirta: It is necessary, sir. If I'm not mistaken, there is already a general WA group, right? Please feel free to spread the information in the existing WA group.

11/30/23, 13:33 - +62 814-1357-4298: Okay, Mr. Yan.

11/30/23, 14:59 - +62 814-1357-4298: Excuse me, sir. After the last announcement that I forwarded, only one participant has confirmed that they are willing to join. May I ask for your permission to confirm, is Mr. Yan also invited to the group?

11/30/23, 15:02 - Yan Tirta: Please go ahead, Mr. Lutfhi

11/30/23, 15:03 - +62 814-1357-4298: Okay, Mr. Yan, Thank you, permission to invite you.

11/30/23, 17:18 - Yan Tirta: Reminder for UGM Team, the deadline to submit the proposal outline is 42 minutes left.

There are still 7 days for improvement.

12/1/23, 06:27 - Yan Tirta: Good morning, sir @628164265148 .

Would you mind sharing the proposal link? With the intention that perhaps my experience in getting funding can help Mr. Nas and the team.

12/1/23, 07:07 - +62 816-4265-148: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/114423

12/1/23, 07:08 - +62 816-4265-148: Good morning.

12/1/23, 07:08 - +62 816-4265-148: Attached Mas Yan

12/1/23, 08:20 - Yan Tirta: Yes, Mr. Nas

12/1/23, 15:55 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon, Mas @6281905378266, I can help you with the following;

1. Zoom link for yesterday's 4th session
2. Attendance for yesterday's 4th session
3. Documentation of yesterday's 4th session<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

12/1/23, 15:57 - Yan Tirta: Note for the Zoom link, please do not share it publicly without me editing it first considering that *I am very pro-UGM there.*

Neutrality in Cardano is important.

12/1/23, 16:00 - Yan Tirta: Reminder, UGM Team who would like to request a one-to-one session via Zoom for assistance in writing a proposal, please inform me. So that a mutually convenient time can be coordinated.<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

12/1/23, 16:02 - Deren T: Here I am sending you the link to yesterday's recording.

https://ugm365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/derentanaphan_365_ugm_ac_id/Ei65ppiUFZFNqrNBSOU3PKsBS4dUIiACTIZXxN6NumRRbw?e=0AIZHl

12/1/23, 16:03 - Yan Tirta: Thank you, Mas Deren. Well noted.

12/6/23, 21:02 - Yan Tirta: Good evening UGM Team. Just a reminder that there are only 20 hours and 58 minutes left until the proposal refinement period closes.

12/7/23, 12:29 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon UGM Team. A reminder, the time to perfect the proposal is only 5 hours and 30 minutes.

12/7/23, 12:31 - Yan Tirta: Advice to avoid last minute updates, because many people submit final proposals last minute.

12/7/23, 12:31 - Yan Tirta: As a result, the website where proposals are submitted often does not update/upload the final proposal.

12/7/23, 17:11 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon Sir @628164265148 , Sir @6281239330962 , Mas @6282264579005 , Mas @6281905378266 , Mas @6281413574298 . Just a reminder that there are 50 minutes left to finalize the proposal.

12/15/23, 10:02 - Yan Tirta: Would it be better to hold the online one-to-one session for the proposal assessment this week or next week?

12/15/23, 10:04 - +62 814-1357-4298: I think it could be next week, sir. It seems like there are still a lot of people who need to travel home and so on this week.

12/15/23, 10:05 - Yan Tirta: Ok, thanks for the info, bro.

12/15/23, 10:08 - +62 814-1357-4298: Excuse me, sir, if it is related to the ppt material on the topic of being a good community reviewer, can you share it, sir? Maybe some other friends would like to try it first before the next meetingüôèüèª

3. Project Catalyst Website (https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/about-project-catalyst/what-is-project-catalyst)

12/15/23, 10:53 - +62 814-1357-4298: Okay, Mr. Yan, Thank you.

12/15/23, 11:00 - Yan Tirta: Mas @6281413574298, please help with information. For those who want to learn the basics of the Cardano blockchain, you can register at: https://academy.cardanofoundation.org/

12/15/23, 11:00 - Yan Tirta: It is a free educational program from Cardano's founding entity, the Cardano Foundation.

12/15/23, 11:02 - +62 814-1357-4298: OK, Mr. Yan, I forward to the group

12/15/23, 11:03 - Yan Tirta: Those who follow will get a "Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate" certificate from the Cardano Foundation. Good for student CVs

12/15/23, 18:43 - Yan Tirta: How about you, Mas @6281413574298, are there any students who are confused about assessing proposals?

12/15/23, 18:44 - +62 814-1357-4298: Until now there have been no messages received regarding the proposal, sir.

12/15/23, 18:45 - Yan Tirta: Noted bro

12/19/23, 13:49 - +62 816-4265-148: Mas @6282264579005 et al, I just filled a Blockchain seminar at the UGM Stock Club (USC) and they are interested in joining us in developing the UGM Blockchain Community, what is the procedure?

12/19/23, 13:50 - +62 816-4265-148: Advice from Mas @6285804602617 is also awaited

12/19/23, 13:55 - Yan Tirta: At a glance, I think the UGM Blockchain Community should be chain agnostic. Or embrace all chains *(Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, etc.)* If it goes that way, I am ready to support it too, Mr. Nas. One way is by trying to open a relationship with the Indonesian Blockchain Association via Mas @6282264579005 or other colleagues

12/19/23, 13:56 - +62 816-4265-148: That's right chain agnostic means it doesn't refer to a particular chain

12/19/23, 1:56 PM - +62 816-4265-148: I've been active on Off-Chain too

12/19/23, 13:57 - +62 816-4265-148: so I'm also connected to the off chain community

12/19/23, 13:57 - +62 816-4265-148: Well friends, if you want to join Cardano, we can do that too, right?

12/19/23, 13:58 - +62 816-4265-148: Indonesian Blockchain Association can be linked too

12/19/23, 13:59 - +62 816-4265-148: https://offchain.social/

12/19/23, 14:00 - Yan Tirta: Well noted, Mr. Nas. It is recommended to learn about Cardano, sir. Just a reminder, Catalyst funding is also intended for inter-chain collaboration.

Additional note, my reminder is that my position is only to assist. Ideally, Mr. Nas and his UGM colleagues should take the lead.

12/19/23, 14:02 - Yan Tirta: Take lead in the narrow sense, spreading the word about Cardano and Catalyst via Mr. Nas or the UGM team, or take lead in the broader sense, developing the UGM Blockchain Community.

12/19/23, 14:09 - +62 816-4265-148: Ready, cc Sir @6281239330962 @6282264579005 et al

12/19/23, 2:10 PM - +62 816-4265-148: @6282264579005 when is the USC meeting scheduled?

12/19/23, 14:13 - Adhikayev: Tomorrow is a bit slow, can I go to DTETI to chat first, sir @628164265148?

12/19/23, 14:14 - +62 816-4265-148: Yes sir

12/19/23, 14:16 - Adhikayev: Suppose morning pripun, sir?

12/19/23, 14:16 - Adhikayev: 8 o'clock?

12/19/23, 14:27 - +62 816-4265-148: Yes Sir

12/19/23, 16:51 - Lintang Asmoro: I am willing, sir, to cooperate with the development of the blockchain community üôè

12/19/23, 16:54 - Adhikayev: okay sipp

12/19/23, 16:54 - Adhikayev: Tomorrow at 8 o'clock we'll go to Dteti

12/19/23, 16:55 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay, Mr. Adhika üôè

12/20/23, 07:58 - Lintang Asmoro: I've been checked, sir üôè

12/21/23, 11:48 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon, Mas @6281413574298, Mas @6281905378266 and Mas @6282264579005.

Please help us spread information about this week's online workshop.

12/21/23, 17:05 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon, sir @628164265148 .

After studying more about offchain.social I saw an opportunity for Cardano to become a "Collaborator and Sponsor".

In this regard, can Mr. Nas bother me by educating me about the information and procedures for becoming a "Collaborator" and/or "Sponsor"?

Please note, my position here again is only to help connect. Later, if it is possible for Cardano to become a "Collaborator" or "Sponsor" so that we can direct it to be represented/accompanied by Mas Lintang.

12/21/23, 5:06 PM - Yan Tirta: Here are the visual references and links to what I mean by "Collaborator" and/or "Sponsor":

Can you help me create a Zoom link from UGM for today's session?

12/23/23, 11:22 - Lintang Asmoro: Good morning Mr Yan, okay sir we will make it üôè

12/23/23, 1:12 PM - Yan Tirta: Thank you, sir. Please provide information to students on three things:

1. This session is ideal for those who have already started assessing proposals.

2. for those who still can't join but will probably just be spectators

3. to connect via laptop so that you can see the results of the students' work so far<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

I would like to inform you, for the follow-up of the formation of UKM blockchain/crypto at UGM, I have communicated with other friends and there will be a discussion with Mas Mumtaz et al (FEB students from Pak Nas) on February 2 in Jogja. Before that, I was in Jogja on January 27 to prepare it further

Please if you would like any direction or message from Mr. Adhika, Mr. Nas, and Mr. Yan. I am happy to receive any instructions if there are any, Sir üôè

Thank you very much Mr. Adhika, Mr. Nas, and Mr. Yan üôè

As promised yesterday above, on the 27th I met Mas Mumtaz from FEB for our plan to establish a crypto blockchain UKM at UGM.

Earlier, Mas Deren and I met with Mas Mumtaz and he agreed to join our community and bring 3 students to join.

1/27/24, 19:53 - Lintang Asmoro: While the student base for crypto blockchain is high, Sir, outside of engineering, last year there was an event from UGM Stock Club filled by Pak Nas, there was also Crypto One on One from Pintu, and crypto education at Fisipol from Algorea. We plan to utilize the student interest base from the events that have been held and collect them in one place at UGM (our community)

The proposed temporary UKM name is "UGM Crypto Connect", with the following vision and mission üôè

1/27/24, 19:53 - Lintang Asmoro: UKM Name Plan: UGM Crypto Connect

Vision:

UGM Crypto-Blockchain Innovation and Collaboration Center

Mission:

2/1/24, 12:07 - Yan Tirta: üìå *There are several questions:*

1. Regarding Indodax's birthday event, is there any clarity on who can come?<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

2/1/24, 12:09 - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr. Yan, if you allow Mr. Adhika @6281239330962 and Mr. Nas @628164265148, I can, sir üôè

2/1/24, 12:09 - Yan Tirta: 2) Can we continue the UGM Catalyst session? Considering there are still 4 workshops that need to be completed?

2/1/24, 12:09 - Yan Tirta: Well noted

2/1/24, 12:11 - Yan Tirta: 3) I have a special invitation on February 24 by Coinvestasi in Jakarta to share about building on Cardano, besides the proposal submitted by UGM, are there any Cardano-based projects that you want to discuss?<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

2/1/24, 12:15 - Lintang Asmoro: Yes, sir, our UGM team friends just need to implement @6281905378266 @6281413574298, we just need to arrange the time, Pak Yan.

2/1/24, 12:16 - Yan Tirta: Well noted. Thank you for the information, sir. When should it be implemented? I don't really understand the situation at UGM ahead of the election.

2/1/24, 12:17 - Lintang Asmoro: For No. 3 above, I am not able to answer that, Mr. Yan, maybe from Mr. Adhika, Mr. Nas or other friends.

2/1/24, 12:17 - Lintang Asmoro: Just a moment, I'll check first, Mr. Yan, I'll give you the news today

Thank you very much Mr. Yan üôè

2/2/24, 08:33 - Yan Tirta: Well noted Mas @6282264579005 . Please note, failure to meet a milestone in one month will cause a decrease in funding delays according to each delay in a milestone.

For example; if you go back a month, the funds will come down the following month, if you go back 2 months, the funds will come down the following 2 months, etc.

2/2/24, 08:35 - Yan Tirta: Related, Mas @6282264579005 will be attending Indodax's birthday, for networking purposes, it is recommended to make a business card.

With the intention that it can be shared during the event.

2/2/24, 08:37 - Yan Tirta: The average cost of printing one box of business cards is IDR 100K and below (depending on the material and finishing).

Sir, you can consult, nuwunsewu, with Mr @6281239330962 about business cards. He has relations with a cheap printing company in Jogja called Ortindo<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

2/2/24, 08:49 - Andy Zico: Thank you for adding me to the group Mr. NAS üôè

2/2/24, 08:50 - Andy Zico: Good morning everyone, I'm Andy from the Eastern Town Hall team, I will be assisting Mr. Yan in running the Project Catalyst proposal at UGM.

2/2/24, 08:50 - Andy Zico: I am based in Jakarta, so please be aware that communication and delivery will most likely be online.

2/2/24, 08:51 - Andy Zico: Hopefully there will be an opportunity to meet you in person in Jogja üôè

2/2/24, 09:27 - +62 816-4265-148: You're welcome, Mr. Andy.

2/2/24, 09:33 - Lintang Asmoro: OK Mr Yan, thank you very much üôè

2/2/24, 09:33 - Lintang Asmoro: Ready Mr. Yan, I also have plans to make business cards for the event üôè

2/2/24, 09:34 - Lintang Asmoro: Good morning Mr. Andy, fine sir.

2/2/24, 09:36 - Andy Zico: Good morning Mas Lintang, nice to meet you üëã

2/2/24, 09:37 - Andy Zico: Since we're going back quite a bit, and our topic is going to be blockchain education using the CBCA program, can you leave a message for the guys to just start?

2/2/24, 09:37 - Andy Zico: 0.5 hours - 1 hour is enough to complete 1 sub-module

2/2/24, 09:38 - Andy Zico: https://learn.academy.cardanofoundation.org/landing

2/2/24, 09:44 - Lintang Asmoro: Yes, Mas Andy, thank you very much üôè

2/2/24, 09:49 - Andy Zico: You're welcome, sir, if you have any questions regarding the material in the program, please contact me.

2/2/24, 19:40 - Yan Tirta: Adding a little background, Mr. Andy used to be an educator at EMURGO Academy. Mas @6282264579005 can coordinate with Mr. Andy to build a network between academics who care about crypto and blockchain. Incidentally, Mr. Andy is close to academics at SGU (Swiss German University Jakarta). From his relationships, he can connect with other academics.

2/2/24, 20:14 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay Mr. Yan, thank you very much for the information. Please guide me, Mas Andi üôè @6281802727507

2/2/24, 20:35 - Andy Zico: Ready, sir, let's study together

2/3/24, 17:29 - Yan Tirta: Afternoon Sir @628164265148 .

I suddenly remembered, the other day I had an offer from a colleague to become a lecturer on blockchain for the Kampus Merdeka program.

But my relationship at that time could not. Is Mr. Nas interested and has time to be a Kampus Merdeka teacher once a week?

2/3/24, 17:30 - +62 816-4265-148: I have quite a lot of load, what can I offer Mas Guntur?

2/3/24, 17:32 - Yan Tirta: Please, Mr. Nas. If there is a fixed candidate for teacher, I can open the conversation again with my relations.

2/4/24, 09:10 - Yan Tirta: Morning Sir @628164265148 and Sir @6281239330962 . Permission to share a program that might inspire.

2/4/24, 09:11 - Yan Tirta: IMG-20240204-WA0000.jpg (file attached) A program from Berkeley. Maybe UGM wants to copy.

https://bit.ly/BerkeleyBlockchainandCryptocurrencyCourse

2/4/24, 09:11 - Adhikayev: Oh this is splendid.. thanks!

2/4/24, 09:12 - Yan Tirta: My pleasure Mr Adhika.

2/4/24, 6:51 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Good evening Mr. Adhika @6281239330962 and Mr. Nas @628164265148

May I remind you, Sir, tomorrow at 3 pm we will meet to discuss the formation of the UGM crypto blockchain community.

Thank you very much Mr. Adhika and Mr. Nas üôè

2/4/24, 19:05 - +62 816-4265-148: Where is the location, sir?

2/4/24, 19:46 - Lintang Asmoro: It hasn't been decided yet, Mr. Nas. If it's in DTETI like yesterday, would you agree, Sir? üôè

2/4/24, 20:03 - +62 816-4265-148: That's fine, please bro

2/4/24, 20:04 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay ready Mr. Nas, thank you very much Sir üôèüèª

2/5/24, 14:36 - Lintang Asmoro: Excuse me, Mr. Adhika @6281239330962 and Mr. Nas @628164265148. I'm already on campus, sir üôè

2/5/24, 14:36 - +62 816-4265-148: Me too, later lab ttt yeah

2/5/24, 2:37 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Ready Mr. Nas üôè

2/6/24, 12:10 - Yan Tirta: Afternoon Sir @628164265148 , Sir @6281239330962 and Mas @6282264579005 .

Because UGM Crypto Connect is becoming more public (I have shared it with several parties including Indodax), I would like to invite you to a casual meet/coffee with Mas Omar.

Reminder, Mas Omar is the official representative of the Cardano EMURGO entity, which also has many connections with Indonesian crypto entities because he used to be at Tokocrypto.

2/6/24, 12:11 - Yan Tirta: Are Mr. Nas and Mr. Adhika interested and willing? If there is a time constraint, Mas Lintang can represent them.

Mas Omar happened to be in Jogjakarta until February 18th.

2/6/24, 12:30 - +62 816-4265-148: Good afternoon Mas Yan, I can, God willing.

2/6/24, 12:31 - Yan Tirta: Okay Mr. Nas, I'll coordinate.

2/6/24, 12:33 - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr Yan, are you ready sir üôè

2/6/24, 19:55 - Lintang Asmoro: Good evening Mr. Yan @6285804602617 and Mas Andy @6281802727507. Sorry for disturbing your time.

Regarding the UGM Catalyst session that we are continuing, which is planned to be held on February 24, we are currently making a poster so that it can be published soon. Our poster design uses the old poster draft.

For this session, I would like to confirm the title, "Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate (CBCA)" is that correct? Please correct the suggestions and input, Mr. Yan and Mr. Andy üôèüèª

Thank you very much Mr. Yan and Mr. Andy

2/6/24, 9:14 PM - Yan Tirta: Good evening, Mas Lintang. Now it's called Cardano Academy. A little additional info that you need to know about Cardano Academy, they discuss Bitcoin and how it works in quite a lot of detail, as well as Ethereum and how it works.

Cardano was just discussed at the end. So it needs to be emphasized, that what they get is a full package. From the concept to the technical language. And what is sought, namely a certificate from the Cardano Foundation, they will definitely get it. Of course, from Eastern Town Hall, they will definitely get it too.

2/6/24, 21:15 - Yan Tirta: In addition to Cardano Academy, we will also teach about DeepFunding. Students who are now can immediately follow this DeepFunding without studying because DeepFunding is related to funding for AI development.

2/6/24, 21:16 - Yan Tirta: Unlike Catalyst, where you have to learn Plutus etc., in DeepFunding, everything you have learned on campus can be applied.

So lucky those who have made things up about AI.<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

2/7/24, 09:10 - Lintang Asmoro: Wow, thank you very much for the information, Mr. Yan üôè

2/7/24, 09:11 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay sir, then the topic/title we are promoting is "Cardano Academy + DeepFunding". Is that right, Mr. Yan?

Please, if I'm wrong, please correct me and give me your suggestions üôè

2/7/24, 10:30 - Yan Tirta: That's right, Mas Lintang.

Additional information for you, everything is related to Catalyst because completing Cardano Academy will certainly improve the quality of Reviewers.

DeepFunding is handled by the team that previously built Project Catalyst. And it's exactly the same, there's a Reviewer too. The difference is that it specifically talks about AI

2/7/24, 10:40 - Yan Tirta: Sir @6281802727507 if there is anything you want to add?

2/7/24, 10:46 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay, thank you for the information, Mr. Yan. Incidentally, yesterday I tried opening the Cardano Ademy link from Mas Andy and have completed Module 1 üôèüèª

2/7/24, 11:34 - Yan Tirta: You're welcome, bro. Keep up the spirit

2/7/24, 11:48 - Lintang Asmoro: Ready, thank you very much Mr. Yan üôè

2/7/24, 12:20 - Andy Zico: That's enough for now, sir. Later, when we have the poster/editorial design, we can add it.

2/7/24, 12:20 - Andy Zico: Great bro, any news from the others about the progress?

2/7/24, 14:24 - Lintang Asmoro: Yesterday I shared the link to my friends, after this I will guide them to sign up and log in üôè

2/7/24, 2:26 PM - Andy Zico: Okay sir, thank you.

2/7/24, 16:21 - +62 816-4265-148: For our community, if I include Mas Guntur and Pak Ayok DTETI, is it OK, Mas @6285804602617?

2/7/24, 4:22 PM - +62 816-4265-148: Also about the Cardano Summit, is there any further information on whether we can co-host the DTETI conference in Bali?

2/7/24, 16:22 - Adhikayev: ohh this is beautiful

2/7/24, 16:23 - Adhikayev: IOG, cardano foundation or their affiliates can be sponsors, Mas @6285804602617 ?

2/7/24, 17:38 - Yan Tirta: Nuwunsewu Pak @628164265148, it seems there is a misunderstanding. This group is an effort from UGM. I only help and provide input. The core spirit of Cardano is decentralization, meaning anyone can get involved and permissionless. As long as it is felt to be for the good of UGM, please go ahead, sir. I believe Pak Nas and Pak @6281239330962 are ethical and have integrity

2/7/24, 17:43 - Yan Tirta: Regarding the Cardano Summit, I will try to follow up again. But thank you sir, are there any details of a similar event that has happened before?

2/7/24, 17:46 - Yan Tirta: I can communicate with you, Sir @6281239330962, but it would be very helpful if there was documentation/details of previous similar events.

2/7/24, 5:50 PM - +62 816-4265-148: Ready

2/7/24, 17:50 - +62 816-4265-148: Can the Chair of the Committee contact Mr Yan?

2/15/24, 12:35 - Deren T: Excuse me, Mr. Yan. May I have your permission to send the revision?

2/15/24, 12:35 - Deren T: IMG-20240215-WA0002.jpg (file attached)

2/15/24, 19:03 - Yan Tirta: Thank you Mas @6281905378266 . For the rest, we are waiting for input from Mr @6281802727507 as the official teacher from Catalyst School.

I believe his experience as an Emurgo Academy educator is very valuable.

2/15/24, 7:07 PM - Yan Tirta: Just a reminder to Mas @6282264579005 , Mas @6281905378266 and Mas @6281413574298 . Mr. Andy has been an official educator per proposal from the start.

It's just that because there was a transition in Mr. Andy's position from Emurgo Academy to the new situation, he couldn't be involved at the beginning.

2/15/24, 7:23 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Okay Mr. Yan, thank you very much for your input and information üôèüèª

2/15/24, 20:11 - Andy Zico: Thank you Mr. Yan

2/15/24, 8:13 PM - Andy Zico: I want to make sure, for the time, are we starting at 10 AM or as I was informed, at 3 PM, right Mas @6282264579005 and Mas @6281905378266?

2/15/24, 8:17 PM - Andy Zico: For the large center section of the editorial, it says:

*Cardano Academy &amp; Deep Funding* by *Cardano Academy*

It seems circular, it seems better:

*Cardano Academy &amp; Deep Funding*
*by Catalyst School* <this message was edited></this>

2/15/24, 8:20 PM - Andy Zico: And for this, for consistency, preferably the one in the top left corner:

*Cardano Blockchain ... (CBCA)*

Can be replaced with:

*Cardano Academy &amp; Deep Funding* <this message was edited></this>

2/15/24, 20:21 - Andy Zico: That's my input, I hope it can be accepted üôè

2/15/24, 9:50 PM - Deren T: Okay, sir, thank you for your input.

2/16/24, 10:32 - Lintang Asmoro: Excuse me, Mr. Yan and Mr. Andy @6285804602617 @6281802727507

We kindly ask you to send us the logo of Catalyst School for publication purposes üôè

Thank you very much Mr. Yan and Mr. Andy

2/16/24, 11:14 - Andy Zico: Okay, Mas Lintang, please wait, I'll send it when I can open the laptop.

2/16/24, 11:16 - Lintang Asmoro: No Mas Andy, thank you very much. From our team, Mas Deren has recreated it

2/16/24, 12:23 - Lintang Asmoro: Please, Mr. Nas @628164265148, if you would like to share it with your studentsüôè

2/16/24, 12:24 - +62 816-4265-148: Ready

2/16/24, 12:24 PM - Lintang Asmoro: üôè

2/16/24, 12:40 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon Sir @628164265148 , Sir @6281239330962 , UGM team (Mas @6282264579005 and Mas @6281905378266 ) and C3ETH team (Sir @6281802727507 )

üìå *The following are the results of* the proposal from UGM:

1. One got funding and two didn't
2. The proposal to create the UGM Cardano dev pool received funding as follows: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/110035

2/16/24, 12:46 - Yan Tirta: üìå *Here is the first insight* into the proposal from UGM:

1. For the CFI proposal belonging to the team of Mas @6281905378266, Mas Giga and Pak Guntur almost got funding
2. Please note that it is very rare for new proposal applicants and those who have just joined Catalyst to immediately receive funding.
3. Future suggestions; (a) continue to engage Catalyst in any way and (b) accept input from the Community Proposal and improve the proposal in the future.<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

2/16/24, 12:46 - Yan Tirta: üìå Here is the proof of almost getting funding:<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

2/16/24, 12:50 - Yan Tirta: IMG-20240216-WA0003.jpg (file attached)

2/16/24, 12:51 - Andy Zico: Congratulations UGM Team üëç

2/16/24, 12:56 - Yan Tirta: üìå *Here are the insights of the two* proposals from UGM:

1. For the token proposal from Mr. @628164265148 and Mr. Guntur, the position is still far from getting funding.
2. Thank you, sir. In the future, it would be good to have a joint discussion session so that I can help with writing proposals, including joint evaluation of input from Community Reviewers.

2/16/24, 12:56 - Yan Tirta: üìå Here is evidence of the proposal's less than ideal position:

2/16/24, 12:58 - Yan Tirta: IMG-20240216-WA0004.jpg (file attached)

2/16/24, 1:10 PM - Yan Tirta: üìå Here are all the proposals that received funding to explore on your own. https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/11/voting-results

2/16/24, 1:18 p.m. - +62 816-4265-148: Ready

2/16/24, 1:51 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr. Yan, thank you for the information. We can't wait to prepare for the next funding üôè

2/16/24, 13:52 - +62 816-4265-148: üëç

2/16/24, 1:54 PM - Lintang Asmoro: üôè

2/16/24, 2:48 PM - Yan Tirta: Great spirit, bro. As long as you are willing to explore Catalyst, it can definitely produce results.

For example, Mas @6281905378266 who is currently involved in two funded proposals. As long as he works consistently, Mas Deren can earn around IDR 4.5 million a month.

Not including Community Reviewer income.

Not yet for individuals who have the skills to create technical solutions. Could create a start-up/company.

2/16/24, 4:01 PM - Yan Tirta: Sir @628164265148 and Sir @6281239330962, I just had a meeting with the Emurgo Academy team directly from HQ in India.

The talk was extensive:

1. from the support of providing free fundamental education
2. from the support of individuals who have built on Cardano
3. from technical support to conducting joint research
4. from technical support to creating custom syllabus together
5. from funding a joint research
6. etc.

All in the context of mass education to prepare as many Cardano experts as possible in the next 2 to 3 years. A forward projection of when blockchain and crypto will boom.

2/16/24, 4:04 PM - Yan Tirta: Currently coordinating so that I can meet with the COO of Emurgo Academy HQ. Most likely, this meeting will happen on February 24, along with the Emurgo event at 5:00 PM.

But they asked for help, can someone from the university come and talk. To find out specifically, what UGM needs.

Is it possible for someone from UGM to meet you?

2/16/24, 16:09 - +62 816-4265-148: I don't have a connection from the Rectorate, but we can still try to get in touch with the Faculty.

2/16/24, 16:12 - Adhikayev: Sorry... after a traffic accident (all okay, just stalled).. I won't call you this afternoon.

2/16/24, 16:14 - Yan Tirta: Well noted, Sir @628164265148 . Regarding the possibility of contact with the Faculty, I will convey.

In the future, I will first find out specifically the time slots available so that Mr. Nas can coordinate efficiently and effectively with the Faculty.

2/16/24, 16:15 - Yan Tirta: Well noted, Sir @6281239330962 . Good to hear. I can be called this afternoon.

2/16/24, 5:11 PM - +62 816-4265-148: It's 10 AM, right?

2/16/24, 6:11 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Thank you very much Mr. Yan for your continued support üôè

2/16/24, 6:12 PM - Lintang Asmoro: That's right, Mr. Nas, I apologize for the incomplete information, Mr. Nas. In the future, we will correct it and it will be an evaluation for us üôè

2/19/24, 20:26 - Yan Tirta: Good evening Sir @628164265148 , sorry to disturb your rest.

I would like to inform you that after coordinating with Mr. @6281239330962, I changed the first meeting with EMURGO Academy India to Zoom first.

Considering the very tight time and the fact that it is not 100% clear how serious EMURGO Academy's intentions are, I want to avoid the possibility of wasting the Dean and Vice Dean's time and at the same time maintain Mr. Nas' good name in front of them.<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

2/19/24, 20:29 - Yan Tirta: The rest I will meet them first to assess them face to face to see the level of seriousness.

I will convey the results of the meeting with the EMURGO Academy team here.

That's for Mr @628164265148 to know.

If there is something you don't like or don't like, please be open to voicing your opinion.

2/19/24, 20:42 - Yan Tirta: Adding, after further coordination with Mr. @6281239330962, I am continuing my efforts to have EMURGO Academy conduct joint research with UGM regarding;

*"Ideation of creating private blockchain-based medical records using IoT facilities from Venindo."*

As an effort to "lock" EMURGO Academy to collaborate with UGM.

That's for Mr @628164265148 to know.

If there is something you don't like or don't like, please be open to voicing your opinion.<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

2/19/24, 23:19 - +62 816-4265-148: Thank you for the information, Mas Yan, this can involve friends at FKKMK, coincidentally I teach at the Masters of Biomedical Engineering with colleagues at FKKMK supervising master's theses

2/20/24, 20:16 - Yan Tirta: You're welcome, Mr. Nas, and well noted.

2/21/24, 11:03 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon Mr Nas. Ngapunten sir, regarding ICITEE, can I tell you why there is no ICITEE 2023?

Is it because ICITEE 2023 is alternating hosts with universities in Thailand?

2/21/24, 11:04 - +62 816-4265-148: Correct, alternating with Thailand KMITL

2/21/24, 11:05 - Yan Tirta: OK, thank you for the information, Mr. Nas.

2/21/24, 11:06 - +62 816-4265-148: Sami-sami

2/21/24, 20:00 - Yan Tirta: Good evening Mas @6282264579005 and Sir @6281905378266 and Sir @6281802727507 .

I am starting to expand the synergy of Polkadot blockchain with C3ETH.

Considering cross-chain collaboration is essential for blockchain adoption. However, my time is limited.

With that said, is there anyone from the UGM team who would like to start investing their time on behalf of C3ETH and UGM Crypto Connect to start collaborating with Polkadot?

2/22/24, 17:39 - +62 816-4265-148: Need additional personnel, if so I'll find you

2/22/24, 17:39 - +62 816-4265-148: ?

2/22/24, 17:49 - Yan Tirta: Yes Sir @628164265148 . However, because it is an addition, there is no need to be invited to the group, just inform Mr Nas if anyone is interested.

To manage expectations, my collaboration system usually looks like this, sir:

1. explore whether the party being collaborated with is interested
2. identify my replacement individual/team
3. information about the parties invited to collaborate with the potential that I bring
4. represents initial discussions with the parties being collaborated with
5. integrating individuals/teams to replace my position

2/23/24, 19:35 - Yan Tirta: Great job Mas @6282264579005 , Mas @6281905378266 and Mas @6287732957780 ! Solid start!

2/23/24, 19:39 - Yan Tirta: Amazing Mas @6281905378266 . Reminder, a track record like this is a strong asset for; 1a) proof to show to the global Cardano community that UGM's efforts have a broad impact

1b) With the evidence above, it will be easier for Mas Deren and Mas Giga to obtain Catalyst funding.

2a) proof to be used by anyone who has the ambition to become a Cardano Ambassador

2b) Remember, the requirements to become an Ambassador are easy: you must have held at least 3 workshops with a minimum of 10 participants.

2c) Remember, becoming a Cardano Ambassador has a compensation of IDR 3 million.<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

2/24/24, 12:07 - Andy Zico: Thanks to Mas @6282264579005 and Mas @6281905378266 for your support today üëç

2/24/24, 12:16 - Deren T: Ready, sir.

2/24/24, 12:18 - Lintang Asmoro: You're welcome, Mr. Yan and Mr. Andy üôè

2/25/24, 12:41 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon Sir @6281239330962 and Sir @628164265148

Sorry to disturb your holiday. Please correct me if I disturb you.

The following are the results of the meeting with the CEO of Emurgo Academy.

What I am saying (partly due to the long discussion), is that I have a direct relationship with the creator of Venindo.

Where with this creator, he is interested in developing Venindo to be a gateway to a blockchain-based medical database using Midnite.

However, at the time of the discussion, UGM did not yet have or was not moving towards forming a Cardano developer base and the Midnite product had not yet been launched.

I also inform about Venindo's background which has received BRIN certification, which has been clinically tested at Sardjito Hospital and there have been sales/requests of 30 units, each of which is worth IDR 600 million.

2/25/24, 12:49 - Yan Tirta: I would also like to inform you that there was a specific overseas inquiry in Africa, but the Venindo team wanted to focus on Indonesia first.

I also explained how Emurgo and UGM can jointly explore the African market considering that Emurgo has a strong position there.

It was also conveyed that Charles Hoskinson himself has a hospital in Wyoming that we can leverage to become a spokesperson if Venindo's products are deemed capable.

All of this has the potential to be achieved if the research is funded by Emurgo. In addition to providing funding, I also asked them to provide technical support.

Based on Mr. Adhika's input. If Emurgo funds the research, Emurgo will get a physical space at UGM whose guards/operators must also be funded by Emurgo.

From the presentation, Mr. Narender, CEO of Emurgo Academy requested the following;

2/25/24, 12:54 - Yan Tirta: 1) Where are the potential directions for joint research papers/papers/written works? 2) What are the potential directions for a mutually beneficial relationship between UGM and Emurgo? 3) Papers/papers/written works should only be 2 (two) pages long.

That's all for Mr @628164265148 and Mr @6281239330962 to know.

If there is anything that needs to be corrected in my submission, please let me know.

If you feel there is a need for a special group, please convey that too.

2/27/24, 3:59 PM - Yan Tirta: Thank you, Mas @6281905378266

2/27/24, 21:22 - Lintang Asmoro: IMG-20240227-WA0005.jpg (file attached) with Mr. Oscar Darmawan, God willing, Indodax will go to UGM, Sir üôè

2/28/24, 05:14 - Lintang Asmoro: IMG-20240228-WA0002.jpg (file attached) Here are the results of my networking search. Most of them didn't have business cards so I immediately exchanged contacts, Sir üôè

2/28/24, 05:18 - +62 816-4265-148: Good sir, the important thing is to exchange contacts and save the details, or search on linkedin

2/28/24, 05:18 - +62 816-4265-148: Thank you, Mas.

2/28/24, 05:37 - Lintang Asmoro: OK sir, you're welcome Mr Nas üôè

2/28/24, 21:31 - Yan Tirta: Good evening UGM Team Mas @6282264579005, Mas @6281905378266 and Pak @6281802727507

Just a reminder, this Saturday we have the second session of Cardano Academy.

For this reason, the things needed to support educational activities must be prepared.

2/28/24, 21:46 - Yan Tirta: You're welcome, Mas Lintang. Just noticed me. Continue the spirit of building UGM Crypto Connect. Maintain and continue to increase the momentum

2/28/24, 9:56 PM - Deren T: Okay, sir.

2/29/24, 08:12 - Yan Tirta: Thank you, Mas Deren

2/29/24, 10:18 - Lintang Asmoro: Thank you very much Mr Yan for your support üôè

2/29/24, 10:24 - Lintang Asmoro: Excuse me, Mr. Adhika @6281239330962 and Mr. Yan @6285804602617

With your permission, sir, if this week's Cardano Academy workshop is moved to 3-5 pm and via online zoom, is that permitted?

Because at 10-12 there is a blockchain seminar by Night Login in the next Department (DTETI) so if we are at the same time it will split the participants. Many participants suggested that Saturday afternoon if possible zoom or online because for their weekend rest time at home. Moreover, the participants are now general (Engineering + Non-Engineering)

That's the consideration of Mr. Adhika and Mr. Yan. Please guide and direct me üôè

Thank you very much sir üôè

2/29/24, 11:13 - +62 816-4265-148: This message was deleted

2/29/24, 16:32 - Yan Tirta: It would be good to coordinate with Mr. @6281802727507 too, considering that he is the session speaker.

3/1/24, 3:19 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr. Adhika @6281239330962 and Mr. Nas @628164265148

Permission to report, Sir, regarding the formation of the official UKM/Community UGM Crypto Connect so that it is recognized by UGM

I have sounded and talked to BEM UGM (university) and they welcomed it. I sent the requirements and what needs to be prepared.

They gave direction to become a community only, not an SME. Because the formation of an SME is complicated and takes a long time, while the community is relatively fast but does not receive funding support from Ditmawa per year. The same thing happened with the UGM Stock Club because they are a community

I would like to send you the supporting documents, Sir üôè

Thank you very much Mr. Adhika and Mr. Nas

3/1/24, 15:20 - Lintang Asmoro: As far as I know, there are two models of student organizations that are given legality by UGM (get funds), there are UKM and communities, in terms of the requirements for its formation, UKM is more complex than communities and takes a relatively long time. The student organization that became a UKM a year ago is UGM e-sport, well at a glance I think UGM crypto connect is actually suitable as a community, because for example, UKM will be bound to participate in an internal quality audit from Ditmawa every year, the process of which is quite complicated. Regarding the management of this status, it can be done through Ditmawa. I'll try to contact friends who understand more, sir

3/7/24, 16:50 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon, Mr. @628164265148 and Mr. @6281239330962

I saw that UGM has an official collaboration with AWS (Amazon Web Service), but when I Googled it, there were no AWS classes with UGM.

Actually, it's a shame if that's the case, sir. Considering the many vacancies looking for AWS certified with quite high salaries.

Are Mr. Nas and Mr. Adhika interested in holding classes for lecturers and students?

If you are interested, I can arrange a workshop with an AWS certified individual.

3/7/24, 16:52 - Yan Tirta: What's interesting is that this AWS class is related to blockchain too

3/9/24, 08:50 - Lintang Asmoro: Good morning Mr. Yan @6285804602617 and Mr. Andy @6281802727507 . Here is the zoom link for 10 am https://ugm-id.zoom.us/j/3437593320?pwd=ZVkrbHM2UnhkS2V0YjBETkhnM2JLQT09

3/9/24, 12:37 - Yan Tirta: Thank you for your time and knowledge, Mr. @6281802727507 and Mr. @6282264579005

3/9/24, 12:40 - Deren T: Excuse me sir, this is a question from a participant who received incentives last week, when will the distribution be, sir?

3/9/24, 12:41 - Yan Tirta: The distribution is every 2 weeks, sir. The workshop became every week because the UGM campus schedule was delayed. This means that after all the participant question data has been entered today.

3/9/24, 12:41 - Deren T: Okay, sir. Thanks for the info.

3/9/24, 12:45 - Yan Tirta: You're welcome, Mas Deren. Please coordinate with Mas Lintang regarding; (1) the list of incentivized questioners and (2) the Zoom link for download. Please share it here later. Thank you and have a nice weekend, mas.

3/9/24, 12:46 - Deren T: Ready, sir. Oh yeah, I want to ask again, sir. Regarding the data sent, is it the email address/wallet address, sir, because there are participants who directly send wallet addresses

3/9/24, 12:47 - Yan Tirta: If you give the address directly, it's also okay. Please clarify the ownership of the address, sir.

3/9/24, 12:48 - Yan Tirta: For example; addrxxxxx in the name of Mr./Ms. xxxxxx. I will send the notification later via Mr. Deren

3/9/24, 12:49 - Deren T: Okay, sir.

3/9/24, 13:02 - Lintang Asmoro: You're welcome, Mr. Yan üôè, thank you also Mr. Yan and Mas Andy for the useful knowledge. I am happy to see the development of the cardano community at UGM which is growing. In terms of quantity, it may not be too big, but the quality and willingness are better than last year üôè

3/9/24, 13:03 - Andy Zico: With pleasure üòÅ

3/9/24, 13:11 - Yan Tirta: Great, bro. Inviting to learn and build on new knowledge is indeed challenging.

The solution is;

1. short-term : incentives
2. mid-term : collaboration with other entities
3. long-term : high-profile real use cases

3/9/24, 17:41 - Lintang Asmoro: I agree Mr. Yan, please continue to support me, Sir üôè

3/12/24, 10:36 - Yan Tirta: Good morning and happy fasting UGM team.

3/14/24, 16:12 - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr. Adhika @6281239330962 and Mr. Nas @628164265148

I was contacted by Mas Andrew from Indodax. Indodax plans to hold a seminar at UGM in June-July with a target of 500 participants open to the public

Regarding this, a zoom meeting will be held with UGM Crypto Connect in the near future. The plan is next Monday. Would Mr. Adhika and Mr. Nas be willing to accompany and join, Sir?

The plan is that Mr Oscar Darmawan and Bappeti will also go to UGM

Thank you very much Mr. Adhika and Mr. Nas üôè

3/14/24, 5:08 PM - +62 816-4265-148: I'm scheduling

3/14/24, 20:17 - Lintang Asmoro: Thank you very much Mr Nas. With permission, Sir, if it is changed to Tuesday night, would Mr Nas be willing? üôè

3/14/24, 20:19 - Lintang Asmoro: Excuse me Mr. Yan @6285804602617 and Mr. Andy @6281802727507, may I confirm for the next workshop tomorrow Saturday, March 16 at 10:00? üôè

3/14/24, 8:23 PM - Yan Tirta: That's right, Mas Lintang. The theme is DeepFunding: How to submit a proposal and how to build a reputation as a Community Reviewer<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

3/14/24, 20:26 - Yan Tirta: I just corrected the theme, sir.

3/14/24, 20:47 - Lintang Asmoro: OK Mr Yan, thank you very much üôè

3/14/24, 21:12 - Yan Tirta: You're welcome, Mas @6282264579005. Btw, Mas, are there very few incentive recipients? There should be 24 recipients. Only 5 (five) people were shared with me via Mas @6281905378266

3/14/24, 9:24 PM - Yan Tirta: I just checked and there is no file. Can you help me find the file/download it directly from Mas Deren?

3/14/24, 21:27 - Yan Tirta: For points (1) and (2) here, I also haven't received the link. Can you help me find the file/download it directly from Mas Deren?

3/14/24, 22:08 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay Mr. Yan, I will follow up immediately üôè

3/14/24, 10:09 PM - Yan Tirta: Thank you, Mr. Lintang.

3/14/24, 22:10 - Yan Tirta: Good evening Sir @6281802727507, has anyone emailed and correctly answered the question when Cardano mainnet will be?

3/15/24, 07:15 - Andy Zico: It was observed that no emails were received by the deadline, and none until this morning either, sir.

3/15/24, 07:20 - Andy Zico: Keep in mind, it was possible to answer multiple questions by the same participant. Is there a record for that? If not, there is one on mas @6282264579005 and mas @6281905378266, I can help you get the numbers later.

3/15/24, 08:21 - Yan Tirta: Well noted. Thank you, Mr. Andy.

3/15/24, 08:59 - Deren T: Good morning, sir. Maybe I don't have any notes, sir. It's just that I asked the participants who received incentives to send me messages. However, that's the only one who sent me messages. Maybe you can help, sir. I apologize for my negligence in not taking notes üôè

3/15/24, 09:13 - Deren T: Excuse me sir, there is one participant missing üôè

3/15/24, 09:16 - Deren T: Okay, sir.

3/15/24, 14:52 - Deren T: Excuse me sir, I want to send a revision, it turns out that some participants answered more than once.

3/15/24, 9:33 PM - Yan Tirta: Thank you, Mas Deren. Looking forward to the recordings on March 2 and December.

3/16/24, 09:09 - Deren T: Okay, sir.

3/16/24, 09:10 - Deren T: Good morning sir, may I send you the zoom link for our workshop later?

3/16/24, 09:10 - Deren T: https://ugm-id.zoom.us/j/3437593320?pwd=ZVkrbHM2UnhkS2V0YjBETkhnM2JLQT09

3/16/24, 09:10 - Yan Tirta: Thank you, Mas Deren

3/16/24, 09:29 - Andy Zico: Okay sir

3/16/24, 09:30 - Andy Zico: After I ran-through the video again, cross-checked it with my notes below, here is the summary, combined with Mas @6281905378266's notes here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jGf-rmGD6x22wRUsF1yNkoR5X80wkbUzOKsbJUd-Ckg

3/16/24, 09:32 - Andy Zico: 1. There are still many who have not sent their wallet addresses, please contact them, sir. 2. There is Mas Sabdo's name there, but I didn't find it in the video, so maybe he replied via the account of one of the participants whose name is there, sir, please confirm.

3/16/24, 09:33 - Deren T: Okay, sir. After I saw that Mr. Sabdo answered it in the 4th series, it turns out

3/16/24, 09:33 - Deren T: In this part

3/16/24, 09:34 - Andy Zico: Okay, so all we have to do is find the wallet address that we don't have yet, right, bro üôÇ

3/16/24, 09:34 - Deren T: Maybe next time to prevent this from happening again I will ask participants to write down their email address/existence directly after they answer/ask a question. Hopefully nothing will be missed again

3/16/24, 09:34 - Deren T: Okay, sir.

3/16/24, 09:36 - Andy Zico: Right away is a good idea, bro üëç It's better to give a deadline on the same day, because maybe they forgot or don't have a wallet yet

Just a same-day deadline, because even if you don't have a wallet, you can create one quickly, in less than 15 minutes.

3/16/24, 09:37 - Deren T: Okay, sir. Thanks for the suggestion.

3/16/24, 11:29 - Deren T: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uQBHZfT2OZaae2i9zZ9fUWmTqC_39mN9XWfeEyPGhR8/edit?usp=sharing

This is the recap result of the QnA earlier, sir.

3/16/24, 11:29 AM - Deren T: Is it true that the number is 13?

3/16/24, 11:52 - Andy Zico: IMG-20240316-WA0001.jpg (file attached) For me, it was 12, sir, Darmawan failed 1 question, so it was only 1.

3/16/24, 11:53 AM - Deren T: Oh okay, sir.

3/16/24, 11:53 - Deren T: Then here is another question, sir.

3/16/24, 11:53 - Deren T: Sir, do we have to use the Yoroi wallet here? Because the wallet I gave you last week was an exchange wallet.

3/16/24, 11:53 AM - Deren T: From one of last week's winners

3/16/24, 11:53 - Andy Zico: IMG-20240316-WA0002.jpg (file attached) Here are the details

3/16/24, 11:54 AM - Andy Zico: Doesn't have to be Yoroi, but it has to be non-custodial Cardano, not a custodial Exchange

3/16/24, 11:55 AM - Andy Zico: The hallmark: starts with "addr1"

3/16/24, 11:56 - Deren T: Okay, sir.

3/16/24, 11:58 - Yan Tirta: Thank you for your time and cooperation, Mr. @6281802727507 and Mr. @6281905378266

3/16/24, 12:02 - Andy Zico: IMG-20240316-WA0003.jpg (file attached) It might make it easier for Mas Deren to verify if the address sent is accompanied by a screenshot directly from his wallet, like this (using the Eternl wallet, there is a logo in the upper left corner)

3/16/24, 12:05 - Andy Zico: Daedaulus, Yoroi, Lace, Eternl, Nami, Gero, Typhoon, WingsRider, etc. all possible

3/16/24, 12:10 - Deren T: Ready, sir.

3/16/24, 7:19 PM - Deren T: Good afternoon, sir. May I send you the recording earlier?

3/16/24, 19:19 - Deren T: https://ugm-id.zoom.us/rec/share/quLzs5Q7AGIXOS4BVZ-bq37Xg5q6OnMPJEqhC1mIObeOBypkGcDqwcWYca6Ddegz.BGyK9fxu-1vzzuxs Passcode: 5Xr2=Su7

3/16/24, 7:21 PM - Yan Tirta: Thank you, Mr. Deren.

3/16/24, 19:36 - Andy Zico: For recording, so it can be uploaded to YouTube, please download the video file as well, bro.

3/18/24, 12:32 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay, Mr. Andy üôè

3/19/24, 08:58 - Lintang Asmoro: Good morning Mr. Adhika @6281239330962 and Mr. Nas @628164265148, sorry to disturb your time.

Excuse me, sir, I am following up on the zoom meeting plan with Indodax. Indodax suggested Thursday. Please join us as representatives of the supervisors/lecturers, Mr. Adhika and Mr. Nas, so that it will be better.

For the time, Mr. Adhika and Mr. Nas, what time would you like to meet on Thursday? üôè

Thank you very much Mr. Nas and Mr. Adhika üôè

3/19/24, 08:58 - Lintang Asmoro: Last Monday night, I, Mas Deren, Mas Gigha, and Mas Mumtaz met offline with members of UGM Crypto Connect at Cafe Pak

Alhamdulillah everyone is enthusiastic and interested in joining seriously. In total, there are 15 people who are serious and want to help prepare the next event with Indodax in June-July üôè

3/19/24, 11:23 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay Mr. Nas, let me explain. For the structure, the heads haven't been appointed yet, Sir, because they are still shy, but they have been placed in their respective chosen divisions such as research, education, trading, media, etc. üôè

3/19/24, 11:24 AM - Lintang Asmoro: Okay Mr. Adhika, it's okay sir. Thank you very much for your confirmation üôè

3/21/24, 14:50 - Lintang Asmoro: IMG-20240321-WA0001.jpg (file attached) Documentation of our meeting earlier, Sir @628164265148 @6281239330962 üôèüèª

3/21/24, 2:53 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Thank you very much Mr. Yan for your support and encouragement üôèüèª

3/21/24, 2:54 PM - Yan Tirta: With pleasure, Mas Lintang. Let's keep the momentum going!

3/21/24, 14:59 - Lintang Asmoro: Ready to cheer up Mr Yan üôèüèª

3/22/24, 1:57 PM - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon Mas @6282264579005 and Mas @6281905378266 . Some time ago I asked for help with several incomplete files including;

1. video recording December 23, 2023
2. video recording 24 February 2024

Considering that I am currently compiling a Close-Out Report/Accountability Report to IOG/IOHK, it is possible that other data will emerge that is still lacking.

Therefore, while I am compiling the report, I suggest being proactive and completing it from the UGM team's side.

I have conveyed what I need in previous chats.

3/22/24, 1:58 PM - Yan Tirta: Please note, based on my accounting there is a possibility of a remainder of around 30 million to 35 million. This number is not yet fixed.

3/22/24, 14:00 - Yan Tirta: Therefore, please cooperate to complete all the missing data so that UGM Crypto Connect can have initial funds/savings from the Catalyst School proposal budget.

3/22/24, 14:00 - Yan Tirta: Funds will only decrease if the Accountability Report is complete.

3/22/24, 14:08 - Yan Tirta: Thank you, Mr. @628164265148 and Mr. @6281239330962 and also for Mr. @6281905378266, a reminder that the *UGM X Gimbalabs* proposal will start soon.

Considering that the team is different and bigger, I will immediately coordinate and recommend one-way communication so that communication is of one voice and is not confused with communication here.

Therefore, so that Mr. Nas and Mr. Adhika are not confused by the many groups, I suggest that the name of this group be changed to *UGM X Catalyst School.*<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

3/22/24, 14:14 - +62 816-4265-148: Ok Mas Yan

3/22/24, 14:18 - Yan Tirta: Thank you Mr Nas

3/22/24, 2:59 PM - Deren T: Okay, sir. There is a little problem, sir. For the February 24th, after searching and remembering, it turns out that I forgot to record it at that time, sir. Sorry for the negligence, sir. For the December one, we also couldn't find it, sir.<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

3/22/24, 3:38 PM - Yan Tirta: Noted. Please make an official report with UGM letterhead that informs the following (depending on the official UGM format):

üìå *Minutes title:* Internal Mismanagement of Zoom Files

üìå *Contents of the minutes:* That a Zoom event has been held to fulfill the KPI Proposal "Catalyst School: Chapter Indonesia in collaboration with Gadjah Mada University" using the official Zoom UGM account on the date;

- December 23, 2023 at<sesuaikan pengumuman=""> with proof of event announcement: </sesuaikan>
-  24 February 2024 at<sesuaikan pengumuman=""> with proof of event announcement:</sesuaikan>

However, due to management negligence, these files cannot be found.

The above statement is known and has been verified directly by the responsible parties from UGM listed in the proposal above.

We apologize for this negligence and will learn from it in the future.

*Signed by the implementing PIC from UGM:* Mas Lintang and Mas Deren

*It is known that the supervisors from UGM are:* Mr. Nas and Mr. Adhika

*Verified Cardano entity C3ETH representative:* Yan Tirta<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

3/22/24, 3:39 PM - Yan Tirta: After all the signatures have been received, the faculties listed in the proposal must be stamped.

3/22/24, 3:44 PM - Yan Tirta: Ideally the content of the minutes should also be in English. It doesn't have to be perfect. What matters is that there is an effort.

3/22/24, 3:45 PM - Deren T: Okay, sir.

3/22/24, 15:46 - Deren T: So, the ones who need to sign are Mas Lintang, I, Mr Nas, Mr Adhika, and Mr Yan. Is that right, sir?

3/22/24, 15:46 - Yan Tirta: That's right.

3/22/24, 16:59 - +62 816-4265-148: Mas @6281905378266 needs to coordinate with Mrs. Silmi if you need the faculty stamp and letterhead, I'll help explain later

3/22/24, 16:59 - +62 816-4265-148: can also via DTMI via Sir @6281239330962

3/22/24, 16:59 - +62 816-4265-148: the point is if you use an official letterhead, it must be signed by an official.

3/22/24, 17:00 - +62 816-4265-148: at DTETI it must be Mr. Kadep

3/22/24, 17:00 - +62 816-4265-148: later a letter can be made with the letterhead of the Head of Department with attachments as mentioned by Mas @6285804602617

3/23/24, 11:55 - Yan Tirta: Thank you for helping, Sir @628164265148 . Considering that UGM has been approved by the community to receive around IDR 1 to 1.2 billion, it is very important to maintain the trust that has been given.

3/23/24, 11:56 - Deren T: Okay, sir. We will take care of it right away, I apologize once again sir üôè

3/23/24, 11:57 - Yan Tirta: Thank you for your cooperation, Mas Deren.

3/23/24, 13:01 - Lintang Asmoro: Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Yan, we will immediately process the statement letter directly on Monday, as soon as possible, Sir üôè

3/23/24, 13:36 - Adhikayev: This is possible, God willing... the department header can be signed by the department secretary/department chief

3/23/24, 1:46 PM - +62 816-4265-148: Well that's good, there's a solution from Mr. @6281239330962

3/23/24, 13:57 - Yan Tirta: Thank you for your cooperation, Mas Lintang, and thank you for your insight, Pak Adhika.

3/23/24, 3:15 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Thank you very much Mr. Adhika, Mr. Nas, and Mr. Yan üôè

3/25/24, 1:07 PM - Yan Tirta: Happy Monday, Mr. Nas, Mr. Adhika and the UGM Team! May the fasting run smoothly for those who are observing it.

3/25/24, 13:08 - Yan Tirta: The follow-up process that occurred for the UGM X Catalyst School proposal was as I mentioned, creating a Close-Out Report.

3/25/24, 13:13 - Lintang Asmoro: cardano academy certificate.pdf (file attached) cardano academy certificate.pdf

3/25/24, 1:15 PM - Yan Tirta: It's according to Mr. Lintang. Thank you for your cooperation.

3/25/24, 1:15 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Thank you again, Mr. Yan üôè

3/25/24, 13:20 - Lintang Asmoro: May I confirm with Mr. Adhika @6281239330962, I have sent the letter of reference for Cardano Academy via web sms ft for your signature request üôèüèª

3/25/24, 1:21 PM - Yan Tirta: Continuing, therefore, the cooperation of Mas @6282264579005 and Mas @6281905378266 is very important. Here is the missing data;

1. All publications/posters/flyers of all Cardano Academy and Deepfunding sessions (just the link)
2. Attendance list for March 16, 2024 yesterday
3. Attendance list and documentation for November 25, 2023 (live campus session with FnB)

The rest is complete.

3/25/24, 13:22 - Lintang Asmoro: OK, ready Mr Yan üôè

3/25/24, 1:24 PM - Yan Tirta: Thank you for your cooperation. Regarding points 2 and 3, there is leniency because the data is less vital but it would be better to have it to build a good reporting reputation.

3/25/24, 14:12 - Adhikayev: there is no header for this, sir. Please send me the MS Word.

3/25/24, 2:50 PM - Yan Tirta: To Mr. @628164265148, Mr. @6281239330962, Mr. @6282264579005 and Mr. @6281905378266

This afternoon/evening I will share the report file again to IOG/IOHK. So that we can get an idea of the future so that when we get funding for the proposal from UGM we already know what kind of report is expected.

In this report there is budgeting, KPI reporting, project timeline, etc.

3/25/24, 14:52 - Yan Tirta: In addition to providing insight, this is also a form of full transparency from me regarding the use of funds and my responsibilities as Project Management for the UGM X Catalyst School proposal.

3/25/24, 2:57 PM - Deren T: Okay, sir. I'll send it right away.

3/25/24, 15:01 - Deren T: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lOZTfM0I9egkPuhyEt6dYYVW1XADA4zyJ23vBWYdGK0/edit?usp=sharing

This is for point 2, sir. However, it may be less valid because it turns out that many participants did not fill it in üôè

5/8/24, 13:14 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon Sir @6281239330962 and Sir @628164265148.

Regarding Venindo, just to inform you that EMURGO is still waiting for the following:

1. Paper/Paper/Written Work potential directions for joint research are in any section
2. What could be the potential direction of a mutually beneficial relationship between UGM and Emurgo?
3. Paper/Essay/Written Work is only 2 (two) pages long

5/8/24, 13:16 - Yan Tirta: Related to the above, as previously reported, Cloud Ace is interested in becoming more involved in Web3.

Cloud Ace here can and has even become a partner of Venindo indirectly through Omron. Omron itself is a client of Cloud Ace.

5/8/24, 13:17 - Yan Tirta: This means that Mr. @6281239330962 and Mr. @628164265148 have 2 (two) potential channels to request funds to further develop Venindo.

One from EMURGO and one from Cloud Ace.

5/8/24, 13:19 - Yan Tirta: Mr. Adhika and Mr. Nas just need to coordinate from UGM/Venindo's side and I will develop the discussion with EMURGO or Cloud Ace until a bright spot or real point emerges leading to real steps.

5/11/24, 7:48 PM - Yan Tirta: Nuwunsewu and good evening Sir @628164265148 , regarding the DTETI event in Bali, ICITEE, have you got the location? And are sponsorships open?

To manage expectations, please do not place any expectations in advance, when I mention "sponsorship".

Thank you in advance, Mr. Nas, for your time and attention.<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

5/11/24, 20:24 - +62 816-4265-148: I'm asking the ICITEE team, Mas @6285804602617

11/5/24, 20:25 - Yan Tirta: Yes Mr. Nas, thank you. Nuwunsewu disturbs the night

11/5/24, 20:28 - +62 816-4265-148: Sami-sami

5/11/24, 20:44 - +62 816-4265-148: The info I got: location already in Bali, open for sponsorship, sponsorship proposal in progress

11/5/24, 20:46 - Yan Tirta: OK Sir @628164265148, for the location, nuwunsewu can you share?

5/12/24, 07:05 - +62 816-4265-148: Bintang Bali Resort

5/12/24, 09:02 - Yan Tirta: Okay Mr. Nas. Thank you for the information.

If the proposal is not perfect, it is not a problem, there are still 3 (three) days to complete it.

The important thing is to submit the proposal first.

5/13/24, 16:07 - Yan Tirta: IMG-20240513-WA0003.jpg (file attached) üö® *IMPORTANT INFORMATION* üö®

Considering that Community Reviewer work requires smooth access to IdeaScale and because IdeaScale loading speed is not constant, please follow these tips;

1. For those who don't have any money to spare, install an explorer called "DuckDuckGo"

2. "DuckDuckGo" is a kind of weak VPN and the free version can be found here: https://duckduckgo.com/

3. For those who can set aside money, you can subscribe to Nord VPN for just one month/during the Community Reviewer work period and can be found here: https://nordvpn.com/

4. The subscription fee is 300K and can accommodate those who do not have a credit card because there are payments using Gopay and Google Pay.

5. You can also try "one one one one" but I have no experience trying it myself 5/16/24, 5:22 PM - Yan Tirta: üö® Important reminder, today is the last day for proposal refinement in Project Catalyst. üö®

*Proposal revision closes at 18:00

5/21/24, 11:13 AM - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon, Sir @628164265148 and Sir @6281239330962. Just to let you know, I have a meeting with the VC on Wednesday at 6:00 PM.

Maybe there is a UGM project that has business potential and you want to promote it, please provide information.

5/22/24, 15:37 - Yan Tirta: Sir @6282264579005, can I be helped with information about the progress of the ratification of UGM Crypto Connect? For example; has there been a letter from the rectorate about its inauguration?

5/23/24, 10:39 - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr. Yan, I apologize for the late reply.

The ratification of the plan from Mr. Nas and Mr. Adhika coincides with the Indodax event in August, launched by the Chancellor along with the issuance of the ratification letter.

That's about it Mr Yan, thank you very much üôè

5/23/24, 11:31 - Yan Tirta: Thank you Mas Lintang. Proud of you. Do I have permission to share this information with the ITB team? With the intention of creating synergy with UGM as well?

5/23/24, 11:33 - Yan Tirta: Please note, even though there is a proposal in the name of ITB in Catalyst, it is not me. It is from another team and it is not ITB directly. It is SBM (School of Business Management) ITB. A branch of ITB that is considered a separate entity from ITB.<this message="" was="" edited=""></this>

5/23/24, 11:34 - Yan Tirta: Please note, the information that is considered a separate entity from ITB is not my assumption, but rather information from ITB representatives themselves.

5/23/24, 3:00 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Please go ahead, Mr. Yan. Okay, Mr. Yan, thank you very much for the information üôè

5/23/24, 6:18 PM - Yan Tirta: Thank you, Mas Lintang, for the update.

5/27/24, 10:48 - Yan Tirta: Good afternoon Sir @628164265148 and Sir @6281239330962

Do I have permission to state the following:

"This student activity on the topic of blockchain and crypto accompanied by AI at UGM is guided and supervised by Mr. Noor Akhmad Setiawan as "according to the proposal" and Mr. Adhika Widyaparaga as "according to the proposal" whose goal is to increase blockchain, crypto and AI literacy among UGM academics."

5/27/24, 10:50 - Yan Tirta: This is in order to establish cooperation with ITB. Which official cover letter before I send it to ITB I will first ACC-ed by Mr. Nas and Mr. Adhika as a step "to be known"

5/27/24, 12:29 - +62 816-4265-148: I'm ok sir

6/24/24, 14:28 - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr. Nas @628164265148, sorry to disturb your time, sir.

Regarding the event at Indodax, it seems better to use SGLC at the Faculty of Engineering. Yesterday, I had a look at the FEB auditorium from Mas Mumtaz because the cost was cheaper but was constrained by the inability to be attended by external parties.

Because Mr. Adhika is still performing the Hajj. Please ask Mr. Nas' permission if you wish to communicate and negotiate with the FT. Does Mr. Nas have time and would you like it, sir? üôè

Thank you very much Mr. Nas üôè

6/24/24, 14:36 - +62 816-4265-148: Yes, sir.

6/24/24, 14:54 - Lintang Asmoro: Thank you very much Mr. Nas. For the time, maybe on Thursday/Friday, is it possible, Mr. Nas? üôè

6/24/24, 5:32 PM - +62 816-4265-148: I'm out of town this week, coming home Saturday.

6/24/24, 17:53 - Lintang Asmoro: OK Mr. Nas, then next week, sir. Thank you very much üôè

6/25/24, 18:19 - Yan Tirta: Mas @6282264579005, regarding this, try coordinating with Mas Giga too.

Perhaps EMURGO India wants to promote at this event so that it can contribute to the cost of renting the building.

Considering that EMURGO India is quite enthusiastic about promoting at UGM.

6/25/24, 6:21 PM - Lintang Asmoro: Good evening Mr. Yan. Okay Mr. Yan, I coordinate with Mas Gigha, thank you very much for the information üôè

7/4/24, 15:07 - +62 816-4265-148: Hey Monday and Tuesday I'm going to Bandung

7/4/24, 15:08 - Lintang Asmoro: What about Wednesday, Mr Nas? üôè

7/4/24, 15:16 - Yan Tirta: Suggestion, because Mr. Nas is busy, maybe the coordination can be transferred to Mr. @6281239330962.

He has returned from Hajj.

7/4/24, 15:17 - Lintang Asmoro: Pripun Mr Adhika, would you like it? üôè @6281239330962

7/5/24, 09:42 - Lintang Asmoro: Ready Mr. Nas üôè

7/5/24, 12:39 - Lintang Asmoro: We are already at DTETI Mr. Nas @628164265148 üôè

7/5/24, 13:43 - +62 816-4265-148: I'm waiting for the info, bro.

7/5/24, 1:43 PM - Deren T: Okay, sir. We are talking to the sglc.

7/5/24, 1:44 PM - Deren T: On the 2nd floor, sir. Exit the elevator and turn left at the assets section.

7/5/24, 13:55 - +62 816-4265-148: Ok I'm going there

7/11/24, 09:22 - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr. Nas, Mr. Adhika, and Mr. Yan @628164265148 @6281239330962 @6285804602617

Permission to provide information from Mas Andrew Indodax. From Indodax, the date is set for August 28, the committee is ready. For Mr. Nas and Mr. Adhika, is it okay, sir? üôè

I also reconfirmed to Indodax that for venue rental they budgeted 0 rupiah. However, for the speaking fee, consumption, and equipment attributes are fully from them.

That's all, sir, thank you very much üôè

7/11/24, 09:34 - +62 816-4265-148: Venue can't be 0 if in SGLC

7/11/24, 09:34 - +62 816-4265-148: If you are at DTETI Hospital, you need to lobby the department first.

7/11/24, 09:34 - +62 816-4265-148: But participants can't be many

7/11/24, 11:33 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay Mr. Nas, thank you very much üôè

7/12/24, 14:14 - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr. Adhika, Mr. Nas, and Mr. Yan @6281239330962 @628164265148 @6285804602617

Let me give you some information, we as the committee still have high hopes that this event can be held.

Therefore, the committee is currently making a ppt for Mr. Adhika and Mr. Nas. If you would like, we ask you to lobby Mr. WD or Mr. Dean regarding the building rental price.

Hopefully with this, the rental price can go down as low as possible, and I can confirm the date with Indodax, because until now I haven't dared to fix the date with Indodax which is waiting.

Thank you very much üôè

12/7/24, 14:20 - +62 816-4265-148: OK bro

7/12/24, 14:20 - +62 816-4265-148: Yes, you have to be sure before you fix it.

7/12/24, 14:21 - Lintang Asmoro: Thank you very much for your attention, Mr. Nas üôè

7/16/24, 14:06 - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr. Adhika, Mr. Nas, and Mr. Yan @6281239330962 @628164265148 @6285804602617

7/16/24, 14:08 - Lintang Asmoro: from Indodax regarding the certainty of waiting, this week and next week are still safe

7/16/24, 14:19 - +62 816-4265-148: I myself am not sure if it is possible to reach 0, especially with our still limited activities, maybe you can consult with Mr. @6281239330962 Mas @6282264579005

7/16/24, 14:19 - +62 816-4265-148: if you really can't do it, there's no need to force it, unless you want to go to DTETI Hospital, I can still lobby you.

7/16/24, 14:20 - +62 816-4265-148: DTETI even uses SGLC, there are costs, let alone external parties

7/16/24, 14:25 - Lintang Asmoro: OK then Mr Nas, thank you very much

7/22/24, 7:15 PM - Yan Tirta: Good evening, Sir @628164265148 and Sir @6281239330962 .

May the news always be good.

7/22/24, 19:16 - Yan Tirta: Seeing the deadlock regarding the Indodax event, I propose that the remaining budget, the result of the Cardano exchange rate difference, from the Catalyst proposal be used to cover the rental costs for the Indodax event venue tomorrow.

7/22/24, 19:17 - Yan Tirta: This is because, I can see that this event will be beneficial in the long term for UGM, the lecturers and the students.

7/22/24, 19:18 - Yan Tirta: If there are no objections regarding the use of this difference in funds, then I will inform the Indodax team to knock the gavel for the event to run.

7/22/24, 19:53 - +62 816-4265-148: I'm ok

7/22/24, 19:56 - Yan Tirta: Okay, thank you, sir @628164265148

12/8/24, 14:39 - +62 816-4265-148: Njih

8/12/24, 16:03 - Deren T: Okay, Thank you sir. üôè

8/13/24, 11:23 - Lintang Asmoro: Good afternoon Mr. Adhika @6281239330962 , Mr. Yan @6285804602617 , and Mr. Nas @628164265148 . Sorry to disturb your time

Regarding the cooperation agreement (PKS)/MoA with Indodax, the Indodax legal team is currently drafting the PKS process. In drafting the PKS, the legal team requires documents from the campus such as: Deed of Establishment, Latest Deed of Amendment (Director Composition), etc.

To shorten the time to make PKS, Indodax recommends it with individuals rather than campuses, because if we make it with campuses, we need legal documents that I think will take a process. If with individuals, we only need the KTP and NPWP of the person in charge as a Lecturer.

The plan is that in addition to cooperation, in addition to opening up employment opportunities, there will also be an Indodax Academy in the form of education and research with students (through UGM Crypto Connect)

With your permission, would either Mr. Adhika or Mr. Nas be willing to be asked for information in the form of your KTP and NPWP, Sir?

Thank you very much Mr. Adhika, Mr. Yan, and Mr. Nas

8/13/24, 11:41 - +62 816-4265-148: Please go ahead, sir, I'll send you a private message later

8/13/24, 11:42 - Lintang Asmoro: Okay, thank you very much, Mr. Nas üôèüèª

8/19/24, 09:56 - Yan Tirta: Good morning UGM Team. May the good news always be with you.

8/19/24, 09:56 - Yan Tirta: For Catalyst administration purposes, I will download and translate all WA group conversations into English.

8/19/24, 09:57 - Yan Tirta: If there are any objections, please provide information along with the reasons.
